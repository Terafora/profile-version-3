# Portfolio Site

## About

This is an updated version of my developer portfolio site to reflect my growth in the field.
This version of the site was built on React using the i18n NPM package which allowed me to include seamless transitions between four languages (English, Japanese, French and Welsh), without the need to load another webpage. Other than the image used in the about section and small images used for my recent projects and translations I have committed to using only CSS and some small SVG files so that performance wouldn't be impacted regardless of what size a screen or device the site needed to be viewed on.

## 🎨 Design 🎨

The design for my updated portfolio site was quite straight forward, I wanted a design which was clean and got across the basic understanding of who I am and what I could do, however I wanted to make sure that my personality and character came across more in the visuals while leaving the text to tell the specifics of what I am able to do.

This being said I've opted to use a design strategy which is similar to what I've used in the past and take inspiration from video games, which is a medium I've grown up with for the last three decades. With this in mind I opted to have certain aspects of the design be a little different to what I've personally come across on the internet, all of which I will go into below.

### Fonts and Colours


In designing my portfolio website, I chose a combination of colors and fonts that I feel represent both professionalism and approachability. The primary color, a vibrant orange, was selected for its ability to evoke feelings of warmth, creativity, and enthusiasm—qualities I associate with innovative problem-solving and the dynamic environments I thrive in as a software developer. Orange also stands out visually, ensuring that the website grabs attention right away.

For the fonts, I opted for a clean, sans-serif style for my name and titles ("Software Developer, Translator") to give the site a modern and user-friendly feel. Sans-serif fonts are known for their readability on digital platforms and their contemporary look, which aligns perfectly with the tech-driven nature of my work. The white text contrasts sharply against the orange background, making everything easy to read while also ensuring accessibility for all users.

The black, rounded buttons ("Learn More" and "Contact") were designed as clear call-to-action elements, placed prominently in the center of the page. I chose this design to invite users to engage further, while the yellow highlights within the buttons tie into the overall color scheme, creating a cohesive look.

Overall, these design choices reflect my aim to balance boldness with clarity, presenting my portfolio as professional yet creative, and ultimately leaving a lasting impression.
